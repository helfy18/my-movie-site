I am trying to catch up on as many 2022 movies as possible, which is clear from the last two weeks.
I still have so many more to go! I really need to watch Nope in particular. So many times I've almost
watched it, but even though I know it'll be good, I still haven't seen it.

In news this week, 40 new episodes of Phineas and Ferb were ordered for Disney+, which is great news for
me, personally. I hope the characters from Milo Murphy's Law make an appearance, and that gets season 3
of that show rolling... In other animation, The Owl House penultamite episode comes out this week, which
I am very excited to see, but still incredibly disheartened with how the show was treated by Disney. They
did not deserve to have this shortened third season and should have been allowed to finish on their own terms.

Check back every Saturday morning for an update to the website, and check the blog page for
a list of the newly added movies!

Coming next week:
- Nosferatu (1922)
- Dracula (1931)
- Plane (2023)
- And more!

I'm back in classes, so the updates to the site (apart from new movies and blogs) will be infrequent. Trust that
I am still working to make things happen though!
